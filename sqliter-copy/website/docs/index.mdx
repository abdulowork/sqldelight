# SQLiter

<span>Sqliter is a low-level Kotlin Native driver for SQLIte.  It is designed to power other user-friendly libraries rather than
something to use directly. Currently SQLiter powers the SQLDelight library on native clients.  At the heart of sqliter is
the public native C interface for SQLite version {versions.sqlite_version}</span>.

### Add Dependency

The SQLiter dependency should be added to your _native_ source sets in your KMP project.

<CodeBlock language="kotlin" title="build.gradle.kts">
{`dependencies {
    api("co.touchlab:sqliter-driver:${versions.sqliter_version}")
}
`}
</CodeBlock>
