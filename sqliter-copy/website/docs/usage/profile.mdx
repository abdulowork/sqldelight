# SQLiter

## Profiling and tracing

Both are possible on the low-level sqlite side, but are not currently enabled in sqliter.  This may change in a
later version of the driver, submit or upvote an issue if this is a feature that you need.

Within SQLiter you can enable verbose data logging using the `verboseDataCalls` configuration flag; as SQL statements
are executed, the results will be logged to the supplied _verbose_ logger.
