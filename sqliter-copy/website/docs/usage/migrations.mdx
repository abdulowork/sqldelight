# SQLiter

## Database version migrations

Sqliter will check the version of the database that you open, and trigger a call to either the _create_ or the _upgrade_ lambdas
depending on what is read from the database.

It is the responsibility of the consumer to determine and execute the upgrade strategy given the connection and old/new version numbers,
and the responsibility of SQLiter to provide the trigger that a _create_ or _upgrade_ should occur.

**Note:** the _Lifecycle_ `onCloseConnection` callback will be called **AFTER** the sqlite connection is closed, and the
corresponding `onCreateConnection` will be called as soon as the connection is made, but **BEFORE** any migrations have
happened.  These are called regardless of the version checking that happens.

:::info Opening a database with no version check

The database manager will skip version checks, create, and update when the requested version is set to
`NO_VERSION_CHECK`. This is useful if you need to do some kind of operation on a database without initializing it.
For example, converting from clear text to an encrypted database.  Using this value is a bit of a hack. The next
major version will likely include a refactor of config to provide a cleaner mechanism to skip version checking.
