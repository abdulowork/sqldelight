## Encrypted Databases

We recommend using [SQLCipher](https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/) for building encrypted databases.  Be aware that
Apple (depending on OS version) may, or may not, also be building against the
[SEE](https://www.sqlite.org/see/doc/release/www/readme.wiki) (SQLite Encryption Extension).  Take a look at the
[Touchlab blog post](https://dev.to/touchlab/multiplatform-encryption-with-sqldelight-and-sqlcipher-5do4) written by
Sam Hill that goes into a lot more details.  The [follow-up post](https://medium.com/@kpgalligan/sqlcipher-and-kmm-58d96ea8095d)
by Kevin Galligan clarifies a couple more details.
